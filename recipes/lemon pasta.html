    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This lemon pesto sauce, a pesto that hails from the Amalfi Coast of Italy, is bright and rich, made with zesty, slightly bitter lemon zest rather than basil leaves. It has so many uses: try it as a spread, a pasta sauce, over chicken, or as the base of a dip.</p>    
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large lemons, scrubbed</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons warm tap water</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons warm tap water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a Y-peeler, remove yellow zest from lemons in large strips, avoiding the bitter white pith as much as possible. This should yield about 1/2 cup zest. Juice lemons to yield 1/4 cup juice. Discard juiced, skinned lemons; reserve any unjuiced lemons for another use.</li>
        <li>Place lemon zest, lemon juice, Parmesan, almonds, water, garlic, salt, sugar, pepper, and 3 tablespoons oil in the jar of a blender; process until lemon zest is finely chopped and mixture is roughly combined, about 15 seconds, stopping to scrape down sides as needed.</li>
        <li>With blender running, slowly pour remaining 3 tablespoons oil through food chute, processing until mostly smooth and emulsified, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down sides as needed.</li>
        <li>Use immediately or store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.</li>
    </ol>
